<p><em>Typical day for this Open Source Advocate… Photoshoot for PineCone BL602 RISC-V Board</em></p>
<p>📝 <em>15 Dec 2020</em></p>
<p>2020 has been… A very challenging year!</p>
<p>Over the past year I’ve been an <a href="https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/my-first-week-as-embedded-foss-advocate">Open Source Advocate</a> for Embedded and IoT. Mostly on PineTime, PinePhone, Pinebook Pro and now PineCone. (Plus a tiny slice of pie… the Raspberry kind)</p>
<p>I’ve made a couple of mistakes… But I shall improve! Here’s how…</p>
<h1 id="be-kinder"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#be-kinder">§</a>1 Be Kinder</h1>
<p>Immersing myself into the Matrix / Discord / Telegram / IRC community was… Whoa! Overwhelming.</p>
<p>There were times when I got impatient and barked (like an angry chinchilla)… Not realising that people among us come from various places, age groups, and have different perspectives.</p>
<p>I’m sorry if I have hurt you or offended you online. I promise to be kinder the next time I connect to the online community.</p>
<h1 id="focus-on-education"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#focus-on-education">§</a>2 Focus on Education</h1>
<p>2020 was an incredible year for PineTime. I ported the MCUBoot Bootloader to PineTime. And the bootloader was shipped to real customers.</p>
<p>But maintaining the bootloader for a shipping gadget is a serious Operational Job. And it clashes with my original objective: Teach IoT with PineTime</p>
<p>Sadly I have to drop my Operational Duties on PineTime… And bring my focus back to Education.</p>
<p>I’m happy to be starting from scratch with PineCone… RISC-V is a Really Good Thing and I’m doing all I can to bring everyone onboard!</p>
<h1 id="keep-on-writing-and-committing"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#keep-on-writing-and-committing">§</a>3 Keep on Writing and Committing</h1>
<p>2020 was a great year for writing and coding. I published 28 articles on all kinds of topics… And I’m super delighted that you read them!</p>
<p>I’ll stick with the same plan for 2021… Publish an article (with code) every 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Expect more photos, sketches and terrible puns. Maybe a silly story too!</p>
<p>Why? Because it’s really tough to get mindshare for Open Source projects. And I’ll do my best!</p>
<h1 id="timezone"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#timezone">§</a>4 Timezone</h1>
<p>This one is tricky… I realise that I’m in the wrong timezone (Singapore). </p>
<p>Whenever I hang out in Matrix / Discord / Telegram / IRC, most of the interesting discussions happen between 10pm and 6am (Singapore time).</p>
<p>Shall I change my sleep cycle?</p>
<p>Or join a community that has more people in my timezone? (Probably Asia + Australia + New Zealand)</p>
<p>Until I solve this problem, I’ll have to stick with asynchronous, non-realtime comms with the Open Source community. Sorry! 🙏</p>
<p><img src="https://lupyuen.github.io/images/advocate-github.png" alt="My GitHub History" /></p>
<p><em>My GitHub History</em></p>
<h1 id="stay-healthy"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#stay-healthy">§</a>5 Stay Healthy</h1>
<p>In September 2020 I started taking medication for Hypertension (Super High Blood Pressure).</p>
<p>Then life became soooo slooooooow. (“Time Goes By… So Slowly…”)</p>
<p>I couldn’t write or code as quickly as before. I had to drop my projects, and do only one tiny project at a time.</p>
<p>(You can see the huge gap around September in my GitHub History above)</p>
<p>I still don’t feel fully productive right now. Hopefully my health will improve in 2021.</p>
<h1 id="whats-next"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#whats-next">§</a>6 What’s Next</h1>
<p>2020 was full of surprises… Can’t wait to see what happens in 2021 😉</p>
<p>I must thank <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/lupyuen">My Sponsors</a> for supporting my Open Source work. It’s great to know that my Open Source work is helping people in the real world… And I shall definitely do better 🙂</p>
<p>Happy Holidays Everyone! Stay Healthy, Have A Great 2021! 😀</p>
