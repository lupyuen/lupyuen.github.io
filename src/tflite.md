# Machine Learning on RISC-V BL602 with TensorFlow Lite

📝 _22 Jun 2021_

_(How a Human teaches a Machine to light up an LED)_

_Human:_ Hello Machine, please light up the LED in a fun and interesting way

_Machine:_ OK I shall light up the LED: on - off - on -off - on - off...

_Human:_ That's not very fun and interesting

_Machine:_ OK Hooman... Define fun and interesting

_Human:_ Make the LED glow gently brighter and dimmer, brighter and dimmer, and so on

_Machine:_ Like a wavy curve? Please teach me to draw a wavy curve

_Human:_ Like this...

_Machine:_ OK I have been trained. I shall now use my trained model to infer the values of the wavy curve. And light up the LED in a fun and interesting way.

This sounds like Science Fiction... But this is possible today!
