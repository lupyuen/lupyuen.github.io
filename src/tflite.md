📝 _22 Jun 2021_

_How a Human teach a Machine to light up an LED..._

Human: Hello Machine, please light up the LED in a fun and interesting way.

Machine: OK I shall light up the LED: on - off - on -off - on - off...

Human: That's not very fun and interesting

Machine: OK Hooman... Define fun and interesting

Human: Make the LED glow gently brighter and dimmer, brighter and dimmer, and so on

Machine: Like a wavy curve? Please teach me to draw a wavy curve

Human: Like this...

Machine: OK I have been trained. I shall now use my trained model to infer the values of the wavy curve. And light up the LED in a fun and interesting way.
