TODO stressful

Keeping alive the Apache NuttX Project can get horribly stressful. That's how we started Hiking 50 km (12 hours) with a micro boombox

That's a bit farther than a Full Marathon 42 km init? In 6 hours

Yeah it sounds mathemagically plausible!

Yeah what if we jogged a little quicker? We might complete the Full marathon in 7 hours!

_Innit similar to Full Marathon?_

TODO Yeah what if we could run

TODO: Pic of hike

_Erm an old man running his First Marathon? Isn't that lethal?_

This cranky uncle is _(nearly)_ aged 60. Our __Marathon Thingy__ has a real [__Risk of Death__](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/race-participant-dies-standard-chartered-singapore-marathon-2024-4780436) or [__Permanent Injury__](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cyclist-jailed-collision-jogger-east-coast-park-5193576).

Thankfully our Marathon Training turned out surprisingly successful! (Haven't run since [__15 years ago__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_physical_proficiency_test))

Let's look back and __Technically Document__ everything that happened, over the past 6 months...

TODO: Pic of injuries

# Run Without Injury

_What's the #1 thing we learnt in Marathon Training?_

[__Running Form Really Matters!__](TODO) This uncle non-runner suffered knee pain, groin injury, sore heels (pic above) ... Until switching to the proper [__Running Form__](TODO)

1.  Lean slightly forward 

1.  Fall forward gracefully

1.  Land on midsole or forefoot 

1.  Landing on the heel? Nope, that's for walking (not running)

1.  Short strides, don't overstride

1.  No stomping or dragging of feet

1.  Every 2 km: Maybe do some stretching to reset our running form. Rotate / revolve the knees. Squat down and twerk sideways.

TODO: Pic of cadence

_"Fall Forward Gracefully?" Won't we run too fast?_

Yep it increases our [__Cadence (Steps Per Minute)__](TODO). We might hit 180 Steps Per Minute! (Pic above)

Breathing becomes super important, while we're maintaining the __Same Cadence__ for 6 hours. Here's how...

TODO: Breathing Diagram

# Breathe Deeply

_What's this Deep Breathing?_

Do this while running (pic above)

1.  Pull into our lungs, as much air as possible

1.  Do it some more, really stretch our Diaphragm

1.  Exhale forcefully. Yep it will sound like a _wheezy grunt_.

1.  Which is a helpful warning for the folks near us: _"Watch out! Sweaty Breathy Monster passing you!"_

_Help I'm panting and breathless!_

Ah here comes the cool trick: We don't really need to run all the way...

TODO: Run Walk Run Diagram

# Run - Walk - Run

_Running 180 Steps Per Minute for 6 Hours, Non-Stop? Impossible!_

Just take a break and walk. [__Run-Walk-Run__](TODO) is perfectly OK for a Marathon!

_But surely we can't walk too much?_

Indeed, we need to complete the Marathon within the __Cut-Off Time__. [(Like 7.5 Hours)](TODO)

We __Count Our Breathing__ (pic above), to be sure that we run more and walk less...

1.  _[Run Phase: Total 50 seconds]_

    Count Our Breaths: 1 to 40...

    Run At Each Count: __Step Left, Step Right__

1.  _[Walk Phase: Total 25 seconds]_

    Then Count Our Breaths: 1 to 20...

    __Walk Briskly__

1.  Repeat the Run-Walk Phases until we complete the Marathon. We're assuming TODO Breaths Per Minute, 180 Steps Per Minute.

1.  Please tweak the numbers above! Experiment and pick the right numbers so we don't run into breathlessness. While still completing the Marathon.

1.  Counting to 40 gets tricky! Let's count in Base 20 instead: 1, 2, ..., 20, 1, 2, ..., 20. Then walk.

_How slow exactly is Run - Walk - Run?_

Run - Walk - Run is not really that slow...

- __Run Continuously__: TODO Per km

- __Run - Walk - Run__: TODO Per km

- Thus we probably ought to [__Start Slower, Finish Faster__](TODO)

TODO: Run-Walk-Run pic

# Run With Mindfulness

_So we're busy counting: 40 - 20 - 40 - 20? All 6 hours of the Marathon?_

Yep that's one good way to practice [__Meditation and Mindfulness__](TODO)! As we're counting / running / walking: Immerse ourselves into the here and now...

- Is Everything OK? Our thighs, knees, calves, ankles, feet, hips, arms, shoulders, ...

- Are our toes bruisin' while we're cruisin'?

- Are we thirsty / hungry / sleepy? Too warm or sweaty? (Beware of abrasion)

- Are we breathless? Heart pounding too fast?

- Are we stepping into a puddle? Or a poodle?

- Concentrate 100% on our running and breathing. No worries about Phone Notifications, Emails, Social Media, AI, The Environment, ...

_Ouch! Something hurts!_

Don't fight the pain! Stop and walk. Do some stretching to reset our running form. Rotate / revolve the knees. Squat down and twerk sideways.

Continue running ONLY if we're really OK...

TODO: Pain diagram

# Marathon Training Plan

_How to get started with Marathon Training?_

Most 6-month [__Marathon Training Plans__](TODO) will look a bit like this. For Every Week: We do...

- One _(Slower)_ __Long Run__ (up to 32 km)

- One _(Faster)_ __Short Run__ (like 5 km)

- Eventually hitting 42 km Total Mileage per week (almost)

- 3 Weeks Before Actual Marathon: Taper Down the Total Mileage

  [(More about Tapering for Marathon)](TODO)

BUT to prevent injury from overtraining...

1.  Every Week: We increase at most 10% of the Weekly Mileage OR Intensity

1.  Don't exceed 10% of the distance of our last Long Run over the past 30 days (TODO link)

1.  Remember to do [__Strength Training__](TODO). Gym not necessary, dumbbells will do. (Think: Squats with Dumbbells, great for strengthening the groin)

_What's the distance for our First Long Run? 10% Weekly Increment: How soon will it reach 42 km?_ 

Ah remember that 10% is the __Compounded Weekly Increment__...

- Suppose we're comfortable with [__hiking 20 km__](TODO)

- Then our very first Long Slow Run could probably be __20 km__

- We extend the distance every week by 10%

- We'll hit 42 km in 8 weeks

TODO: Pic of calculator

Now watch what happens if we disrespect the 10% rule...

# Train The WRONG Way

_The 10% Rule for Weekly Mileage / Intensity: What happens if we DON'T follow it?_

This reckless uncle did everything the wrong way, asking for trouble...

TODO: Pic of distance

Subsequently suffering Knee Injury / Groin Injury / Toenail Fallout...

TODO: Pic of injuries

Many thanks to Sports Therapist David for teaching this clumsy otaku how everything in the body is connected, and why they're hurting!

(Everyone ought to consult a Sports Physician before starting Marathon Training)

TODO: Pic of 42 km weekly run

_Whoa running a 42 km Marathon every single week? That's bonkers!_

Weirdly, the __42 km Weekly Run__ works OK for me...

- 7 hours of pure bliss, no distraction, just mindful meditation 

- Though we start at 3 am and finish at 10 am, which feels a bit too hot

- I'm lucky the 42 km run is __Mostly Painless__ (except 3 bruised toes and a sore heel). Everything recovers quickly, within a day.

# Appendix: Troubleshoot Our Marathon

[Wise folks say](https://genius.com/Baz-luhrmann-everybodys-free-to-wear-sunscreen-lyrics): _"The race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself."_ So let's help ourselves...

1.  _How fast are we running every km? Do we really need a Smart Watch?_

    Nope, Smart Watch not necessary! Bring a phone with Strava installed. Configure Strava to speak out the __Split Timings__, for every kilometre / mile.

1.  _Legs are seriously aching!_

    Remember to breathe deep, [stretch the diaphragm](TODO). Drinking too much water might cause [leg cramps](TODO). But if we're peeing too little during a run, please drink up right now!

1.  _Abrasion of thighs, nipples, butt, ..._

    Before Running: Apply Body Glide AND Micropore Tape (pic above). If it hurts after the run: Apply more Micropore Tape, and remove the next day.

1.  _Toenails are turning blue / black / purple!_

    Try [Larger Blister-Free Quick-Dry Socks](TODO). Or Larger Shoes [(US Size 11, Asics Gel Kayano)](TODO). Before Running: Wrap the affected toes in Micropore Tape.

    TODO: Toe diagram 

1.  _Outer Knee hurts!_

    Try running one minute with the affected knee / foot turned slightly inward. If it feels OK: Continue running with knees and feet pointing straight ahead. Apply some strength to the knee, as the foot strikes the ground.

1.  _Bladder seems to be slightly bleeding internally?_

    If we're wearing a [Waist Pouch / Fanny Pack](TODO): Position the pouch in front of the tummy. Move the Plastic Clip behind. Be careful when bending down.

1.  _Will we lose weight?_

    Actually I gained 10 kg over 6 months of Marathon Training, now weighing 70 kg. Maybe due to Weekly Carbo Loading + Strength Training + Creatine? Now Experimenting: Intermittent Fasting after running.

# Appendix: Eat While Running

_Running 6 hours on an Empty Stomach? So inhumane!_

That's why we [__Eat While We Run__](TODO) (pic above)

- [__Eat More Carbs__](TODO) the day before

- __Light Snack__ just before the run

- Every 30 minutes (or 5 km): Slurp an __Energy Gel__ (23 grams of carbs)

- Which means we'll run with __Plenty of Energy Gels__...

  TODO: Pic of gel

- Plan our Long Runs around __Vending Machines__ and 7-Eleven Stores

- Like this 42 km route, which has 24-hour __Public Toilets__ every 2 km...

TODO: Route map

# Appendix: Taper Before Marathon

_What's this tapering?_

3 Weeks before the Actual Marathon, we [__taper down__](TODO) or reduce the mileage and intensity of our Marathon Training. Why 3 weeks?

- __Risk Management__: Most Running Injuries will (probably) take at most 3 weeks to heal. Makes sense to taper down our running 3 weeks before a Marathon, in case we injure ourselves during training.

- [__30-Day Window__](TODO): Research says that we shouldn't exceed 10% of the distance of our last Long Run over the past 30 days. So we should probably run 42 km, then taper down 3 weeks before the Marathon.

TODO: Pic of tapering

_How much to taper down for our runs?_

- Maybe run 10 km, thrice a week? (Pic above)

- Have a [__Fun Run with Friends__](TODO), so we don't stress out too much

- In the Short Runs: [__Acclimatise our bodies__](TODO) to the local weather

_But the Taper Period feels really anxious and stressful!_

Yeah that's the [__Taper Tantrum__](TODO). Try these fixes...

- Blog about our [__Marathon Training__](TODO)

- Plan for the [__Next Marathon__](TODO)
