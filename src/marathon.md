[_42 km Final Marathon Training_](https://www.strava.com/activities/16399545262)

Keeping alive the [__Apache NuttX Project__](https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html) can get [__horribly stressful__](https://lupyuen.org/articles/ci3).

That's how I started [__Hiking 50 km__](https://www.strava.com/activities/14097873953) over 12 hours...

_Innit similar to 42 km Full Marathon?_

Yeah what if we jogged a little quicker? We might complete the __42 km Full Marathon__ in 6 hours... Mathemagically plausible!

_Old Man running his First Marathon? Isn't that lethal?_

This cranky uncle is _(nearly)_ aged 60. Our __Marathon Thingy__ has a real [__Risk of Death__](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/race-participant-dies-standard-chartered-singapore-marathon-2024-4780436) or [__Permanent Injury__](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cyclist-jailed-collision-jogger-east-coast-park-5193576).

Thankfully our Marathon Training turned out surprisingly successful! (Haven't run since [__15 years ago__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_physical_proficiency_test))

Let's look back and __Technically Document__ everything that happened, over the past 6 months...

[_Injured by Bad Running Form_](https://www.strava.com/athletes/110000425)

# Run Without Injury

_What's the #1 thing we learnt in Marathon Training?_

[__Running Form Really Matters!__](https://runrepeat.com/guides/10-principles-of-proper-running-form) This uncle non-runner suffered knee pain, groin injury, sore heels (pic above) ... Until switching to the proper [__Running Form__](https://runrepeat.com/guides/10-principles-of-proper-running-form)

1.  Lean slightly forward 

1.  Fall forward gracefully

1.  Land on midsole or forefoot 

1.  Landing on the heel? Nope, that's for walking (not running)

1.  Short strides, don't overstride

1.  No stomping or dragging of feet

1.  Every 2 km: Maybe do some stretching to reset our running form. Rotate / revolve the knees. Squat down and twerk sideways.

![Cadence roughly 180 steps per minute](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/marathon-cadence.png)

[_Cadence roughly 180 steps per minute_](https://www.strava.com/activities/16440957669/overview)

_"Fall Forward Gracefully?" Won't we run too fast?_

Yep it increases our [__Cadence (Steps Per Minute)__](https://lupyuen.org/articles/marathon#appendix-cadence---steps-per-minute). We might hit 180 Steps Per Minute! (Pic above)

Breathing becomes super important, while we're maintaining the __Same Cadence__ for 6 hours. Here's how...

[(More about Cadence)](https://lupyuen.org/articles/marathon#appendix-cadence---steps-per-minute)

![Deep Breathing](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/marathon-breath2.jpg)

# Breathe Deeply

_What's this Deep Breathing?_

Do this while running (pic above)

1.  [__Breathe In Deep:__](https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a63952723/diaphragm-breathing-exercises/) Pull deep into our lungs, as much air as possible

1.  __Breathe Some More:__ Really stretch our Diaphragm

1.  __Exhale Forcefully:__ Yep it will sound like a _wheezy grunt_.

1.  Which is a helpful warning for the folks near us: _"Watch out! Sweaty Breathy Monster passing you!"_

1.  Step __Left - Right - Left - Right__ in One Single Breath

_Help I'm panting and breathless!_

Ah here comes the cool trick: We don't really need to run all the way...

![Run - Walk - Run](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/marathon-runwalk.jpg)

# Run - Walk - Run

_Running 180 Steps Per Minute for 6 Hours, Non-Stop? Impossible!_

Just take a break and walk. [__Run-Walk-Run__](https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a62938197/what-is-run-walk-method/) is perfectly OK for a Marathon!

_But surely we can't walk too much?_

Indeed, we need to complete the Marathon within the __Cut-Off Time__. [(Like 7.5 Hours)](https://www.singaporemarathon.com/races/marathon/)

We [__Count Our Breathing__](https://youtube.com/shorts/ApxC1ldmurY?si=C1L9hZtZGwayQJJY) (pic above), to be sure that we run more and walk less...

1.  _[Run Phase: Total 50 seconds]_

    Count Our Breaths: 1 to 40...

    Run At Each Count: __Step Left - Right - Left - Right__

1.  _[Walk Phase: Total 25 seconds]_

    Then Count Our Breaths: 1 to 20...

    __Walk Briskly__

1.  Repeat the __Run-Walk Phases__ until we complete the Marathon. We're assuming 25 Breaths Per Minute, 180 Steps Per Minute.

1.  Please [__tweak the numbers__](https://youtu.be/ygvMSQ6ZZk8?si=9Xj-8EPdgqNVmzTr) above! Experiment and pick the right numbers so we don't run into breathlessness. While still completing the Marathon.

1.  Counting to 40 gets tricky! Let's count in Base 20 instead: 1, 2, ..., 20, 1, 2, ..., 20. Then walk...

![Count to 40 then walk](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/marathon-breath.jpg?1)

_How slow exactly is Run - Walk - Run?_

Run - Walk - Run is not really that slow...

- __Run Continuously__: 6.4 minutes per km

- __Run - Walk - Run__: 7.0 minutes per km

- Thus we probably ought to [__Start Slower, Finish Faster__](https://www.runnersworld.com/beginner/a65510381/negative-splits-racing/)

  [(Run - Walk - Run will complete a marathon __within 6 hours__)](https://www.strava.com/activities/16671391778/overview)

![Run Continuously vs Run-Walk-Run](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/marathon-runvswalk.jpg)

[_Run Continuously vs Run-Walk-Run_](https://www.strava.com/activities/16529249481)

# Run With Mindfulness

_So we're busy counting: 40 - 20 - 40 - 20? All 6 hours of the Marathon?_

Yep that's one good way to practice [__Meditation and Mindfulness__](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/motivation/a69424106/running-without-music/)! As we're counting / running / walking: Immerse ourselves into the here and now...

- Is Everything OK? Our thighs, knees, calves, ankles, feet, hips, arms, shoulders, ...

- Are our toes bruisin' while we're cruisin'?

- Are we thirsty / hungry / sleepy? Too warm or sweaty? (Beware of abrasion)

- Are we breathless? Heart pounding too fast?

- Are we stepping into a puddle? Or a poodle?

- Concentrate 100% on our running and breathing. No worries about Phone Notifications, Emails, Pull Requests, Social Media, AI, The Environment, ...

_Ouch! Something hurts!_

__Don't fight the pain!__ Stop and walk. Do some stretching to reset our running form. Rotate / revolve the knees. Squat down and twerk sideways.

Continue running ONLY if we're really OK. [(More Troubleshooting Tips)](https://lupyuen.org/articles/marathon#appendix-troubleshoot-our-marathon)

# Marathon Training Plan

_How to get started with Marathon Training?_

Most 6-month [__Marathon Training Plans__](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/a760108/basic-marathon-schedules/) will look a bit like this. For Every Week: We do...

- One _(Slower)_ __Long Run__ (up to 32 km)

- One _(Faster)_ __Short Run__ (like 5 km)

- Eventually hitting __42 km Total Mileage__ per week (almost)

- 3 Weeks Before Actual Marathon: [__Taper Down__](https://lupyuen.org/articles/marathon#appendix-taper-before-marathon) the Weekly Mileage

  [(More about Tapering for Marathon)](https://lupyuen.org/articles/marathon#appendix-taper-before-marathon)

BUT to prevent injury from overtraining...

1.  Every Week: We increase at most [__10% of the Weekly Mileage OR Intensity__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpudk95fWJY)

1.  [__Don't Exceed 10%__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5sd9ex0y7k) of the distance of our last Long Run over the past 30 days

1.  Remember to do [__Strength Training__](https://youtu.be/LMtW9uB2Z1o?si=FJ6AaaECxFZpeOWF). Gym not needed, dumbbells will do. (Think: Squats with Dumbbells, great for strengthening the groin)

1.  Don't forget to [__Eat During Long Runs__](https://lupyuen.org/articles/marathon#appendix-eat-while-running)

_What's the distance for our First Long Run? For 10% Weekly Increment: How soon will it reach 42 km?_ 

Ah remember that 10% is the __Compounded Weekly Increment__...

- Suppose we're comfortable with [__hiking 20 km__](https://www.strava.com/activities/13251912755)

- Then our very first Long Slow Run could probably be __20 km__

- We extend the distance every week by 10%

- We'll hit 42 km in __8 weeks__

>>> ![Hitting 42 km in 8 weeks](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/marathon-calc.png)

Now watch what happens if we disrespect the 10% rule...

# Train The WRONG Way

_The 10% Rule for Weekly Mileage / Intensity: What happens if we DON'T follow it?_

This reckless uncle did everything [__the wrong way__](https://www.strava.com/athletes/110000425), asking for trouble...

![Marathon Overtraining](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/marathon-mileage2.jpg)

Subsequently suffering Knee Injury / Groin Injury / Toenail Fallout...

![Overtraining Injuries](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/marathon-mileage.jpg?1)

Many thanks to Sports Therapist David for teaching this clumsy otaku how everything in the body is connected, and why they're hurting!

(Everyone ought to consult a Sports Physician before starting Marathon Training)

![Running a 42 km Marathon every single week](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/marathon-nutrition3.jpg)

_Whoa running a 42 km Marathon every single week? That's bonkers!_

Weirdly, the [__42 km Weekly Run__](https://youtu.be/GrPjCXv7qgY?si=26P2gB-556CrMJsh) works OK for me...

- 7 hours of pure bliss, no distraction, just mindful meditation 

- Though we start at 3 am and finish at 10 am, which feels a bit too hot

- I'm lucky the 42 km run is [__Mostly Painless__](https://www.strava.com/activities/16399545262) (except 3 bruised toes and a sore heel). Everything recovers quickly, within a day.

# What's Next

_Will we chase Marathon PBs? (Personal Best, not Peanut Butter)_

Sorry we're a bit too old to chase PBs. Instead, let's leisurely enjoy other marathons happening near home...

# Appendix: Troubleshoot Our Marathon

[Wise folks say](https://genius.com/Baz-luhrmann-everybodys-free-to-wear-sunscreen-lyrics): _"The race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself."_ So let's help ourselves...

1.  _How fast are we running every km? Do we really need a Smart Watch?_

    Nope, Smart Watch not necessary! Bring a phone with Strava installed. Configure Strava to speak out the __Split Timings__, for every kilometre / mile.

1.  _Legs are seriously aching!_

    Remember to breathe deep, [stretch the diaphragm](https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a63952723/diaphragm-breathing-exercises/). Drinking too much water might cause [leg cramps](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/nutrition/hydration/a774377/the-dangers-of-over-hydrating-during-a-race/). But if we're peeing too little during a run, please drink up right now!

1.  _Abrasion of thighs, nipples, butt, shoulder, ..._

    Before Running: Apply Body Glide AND Micropore Tape (pic above). If it hurts after the run: Apply more Micropore Tape, and remove the next day.

1.  _Toenails are turning blue / black / purple!_

    Try [Larger Blister-Free Quick-Dry Socks](https://www.compressport.com/inter/en/pro-socks/1824-pro-racing-socks-v40-run-low-white-black-7630102563252.html). Or Larger Shoes [(US Size 11, Asics Gel Kayano)](https://www.strava.com/activities/15735312179). Before Running: Wrap the affected toes in Micropore Tape...

    ![Wrapping injured toes in Micropore Tape](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/marathon-toe.jpg)

    If the Toe Nail starts growing away from the Nail Bed (because of a scar or blister underneath): Use a Nail File to file away the gnarly bits.

1.  _Outer Knee hurts!_

    Try running one minute with the affected knee / foot turned slightly inward. If it feels OK: Continue running with knees and feet pointing straight ahead. Apply some strength to the knee, as the foot strikes the ground.

1.  _Bladder seems to be slightly bleeding internally?_

    If we're wearing a [Waist Pouch / Fanny Pack](https://www.strava.com/activities/16529249481): Position the pouch in front of the tummy. Move the Plastic Clip behind. Be careful when bending down.

1.  _Will we lose weight?_

    Actually I gained 10 kg over 6 months of Marathon Training, now weighing 70 kg. Maybe due to Weekly Carbo Loading + Strength Training + Creatine? Now Experimenting: Intermittent Fasting after running.

1.  _Feeling so moody and irritated!_

    Long Runs might affect [Testosterone Level](https://runningmagazine.ca/sections/training/what-happens-to-your-body-after-a-marathon/).

![Eating while running 42 km](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/marathon-nutrition.jpg?1)

[_Eating while running 42 km_](https://www.strava.com/activities/16399545262)

# Appendix: Eat While Running

_Running 6 hours on an Empty Stomach? So inhumane!_

That's why we [__Eat While We Run__](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/nutrition/diet/a776033/how-to-fuel-your-body-best-during-marathon-training/) (pic above) for Long Runs...

- Day Before Run: [__Eat More Carbs__](https://youtu.be/LzYq-2b0URk?si=_urcCzD0MrZOSFOu)

- Just Before Run: Have a [__Light Snack__](https://teamwarrior.com/products/warrior-crunch-protein-bars-12s). If Possible: Do a Core Dump and empty our bowels.

- Every 30 minutes (or 5 km): Slurp an [__Energy Gel__](https://guenergy.com/products/energy-gel) (22 grams of carbs)

- Which means we'll carry [__Plenty of Energy Gels__](https://www.strava.com/activities/16399545262). Got a mix of Caffeine and Non-Caffeine Energy Gels? Save the __Caffeine Energy Gels__ for the Second Half of the run.

  ![Carrying plenty of Energy Gels](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/marathon-gel.jpg)

- During The Run: Our Digestive System might work a little slower, because the bloodflow is diverted for running. Beware of foods that might [__cause LS__](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lao_sai).

- After The Run: Drink some __High-Protein Milk + Creatine__, to reboot our Digestive System

- Don't carry too much food: Plan our Long Runs around __Vending Machines__ and 24-hour 7-Eleven Stores

- Like this [__42 km Bestest Route__](https://www.strava.com/routes/3420213324753761400), which has 24-hour __Public Toilets__ every 2 km...

![42 km Route - Toilets every 2 km, ample vending machines, 7-Eleven stores](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/marathon-route.png)

[_42 km Route - Toilets every 2 km, ample vending machines, 7-Eleven stores_](https://www.strava.com/routes/3420213324753761400)

# Appendix: Taper Before Marathon

_What's this tapering?_

3 Weeks before the Actual Marathon, we [__Taper Down__](https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a68119669/how-to-taper-for-marathon/) or reduce the mileage and intensity of our Marathon Training (to prevent over-training). Why 3 weeks?

- __Risk Management__: Most Running Injuries will (probably) take at most 3 weeks to heal. Makes sense to taper down our running 3 weeks before a Marathon, in case we injure ourselves during training.

- [__30-Day Window__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5sd9ex0y7k): Research says that we shouldn't exceed 10% of the distance of our last Long Run over the past 30 days. So we should probably run 42 km, then taper down 3 weeks before the Marathon.

![3-week Taper before Marathon](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/marathon-taper2.jpg)

[_3-week Taper before Marathon_](https://www.strava.com/athletes/110000425)

_How much to taper down for our runs?_

- Maybe run 10 km, thrice a week? (Pic above)

- Have a [__Fun Run with Friends__](https://www.strava.com/activities/16460911748), so we don't stress out too much

- In the Short Runs: [__Acclimatise our bodies__](https://www.strava.com/activities/16567975390) to the local weather

_But the Taper Period feels really anxious and stressful!_

Yeah that's the [__Taper Tantrum__](https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a69042089/how-to-deal-with-taper-stress/). Try these fixes...

- Blog about our [__Marathon Training__](https://lupyuen.org/articles/marathon)

- Plan for the [__Next Marathon__](https://lupyuen.org/articles/marathon#whats-next). Book the Flight and Hotel.

- Do a [__DNA Test__](https://www.23andme.com) and discover our Inherited Traits. Apparently I got the genes for Long Runs, not Short Runs.

# Appendix: Cadence - Steps Per Minute

_What's this Cadence?_

Suppose we're in an __EDM Club__. The DJ plays a song at 168 bpm. Then everyone bounces around, also at 168 bpm.

[__Cadence (Steps Per Minute)__](https://youtu.be/QUn6vJW1mEI?si=tIJpFHKA33tdfCUY) is a bit like that, but more chaotic...

- [__Different Folks__](https://youtu.be/9hMPTKSvALo?si=qqDo9CrDwD5zjV3q) have Different Cadence

- [__Higher Cadence__](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/beginners/a772845/a-beginners-guide-to-cadence/) (say 180 steps per minute) might improve Running Form and Prevent Injury

- That's because we're running with [__Shorter Strides__](https://www.runnersworld.com/training/a45303969/what-is-overstriding/) (not overstriding)

- [__Running Uphill?__](https://youtu.be/HgeTHa_svGI?si=WCxu0Gh09bowfLqL) Use Shorter Strides. Or Walk.

- [__Running Downhill?__](https://youtu.be/HgeTHa_svGI?si=WCxu0Gh09bowfLqL) We could use Longer Strides, to catch up on lost time. But Shorter Strides are probably safer for newbies.
