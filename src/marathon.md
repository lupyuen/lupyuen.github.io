Keeping alive the Apache NuttX Project can get horribly stressful. That's how we started Hiking 50 km (12 hours) with a micro boombox

That's a bit farther than a Full Marathon 42 km init? In 6 hours

Yeah it sounds mathemagically plausible!

Yeah what if we jogged a little quicker? We might complete the Full marathon in 7 hours!

_Innit similar to Full Marathon?_

TODO Yeah what if we could run

TODO: Pic of hike

_Erm an old man running his First Marathon? Isn't that lethal?_

This cranky uncle is _(nearly)_ aged 60. Our __Marathon Thingy__ has a real [__Risk of Death__](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/race-participant-dies-standard-chartered-singapore-marathon-2024-4780436) or [__Permanent Injury__](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cyclist-jailed-collision-jogger-east-coast-park-5193576).

Thankfully our Marathon Training turned out surprisingly successful! (Haven't run since [__15 years ago__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_physical_proficiency_test))

Let's look back and __Technically Document__ everything that happened, over the past 6 months...

# Run Without Injury

_What's the #1 thing we learnt in Marathon Training?_

[__Running Form Really Matters!__](TODO). This uncle non-runner suffered knee pain, groin injury, foot pain ... Until switching to the proper running form
1.  Lean slightly forward 
1.  Fall forward gracefully
1.  Land on midsole or forefoot 
1.  Landing on the heel? Nope, that's for walking (not running)
1.  Short strides, don't overstride
1.  No stomping or dragging of feet

_"Fall Forward Gracefully?" Won't we run too fast?_

Yep it increases our [__Cadence (Steps Per Minute)__](TODO).

Breathing becomes super important, while we're maintaing the __Same Cadence__ for 6 hours.

# In Case Of Injury

# Run - Walk - Run

TODO

Run-Walk-Run is perfectly OK!

Walking 
Shake a leg. Is anything broken? 

Step into a puddle 
Or a poodle

# Cadence - Steps Per Minute

TODO

What's this cadence 
Edm 168 Bpm bouncing around
Overstride
Understride
Downhill increase cadence

For 167 70 natural cadence is probably??? 

Running the 10 km with friends 
High cadence, short strides

# Marathon Training Plan

TODO

Increase 10% distance OR intensity 
Last 30 days
Max 32 km for long runs 
Shorter faster runs e.g. 5 km

Research paper 
Please try not to exceed 10% of the distance of our last Long Run over the past 30 days

Strength Training
Dumbbells
No gym

# Training The WRONG Way

TODO

This reckless uncle did everything the wrong way, asking for trouble 

Many thanks to Sports Therapist David for teaching this clumsy otaku how everything in my body is connected, and why they are in pain 

10% injury 
First long run was painful gruelling 42 km
Today 42 km + 5 km
Mostly painless 
Quick recovery within a day 

Whoa running a full marathon every week?
Overtraining?
Weirdly it works OK for me. Maybe because 
7 hours including toilet breaks, snack raids at 7 Eleven 
Finishing cut off
Maybe visit regional marathons
Zero ambition of running quicker at my age

Toes
Maybe shouldn't run weekly?

# Running With Mindfulness

TODO

7 hours out in the sun?
Start at 3am
Finish at 10am, getting a bit too warm
7 hours of pure bliss, no phone distractions, just mindful meditation 

Mindfulness?
Check if knees, hips, ankles, are ok
Are we thirsty or hungry?
Sleepy?
Heart rate
Breathing 
Too warm?
Too sweaty?
Are my toes bruisin' while I'm cruisin'?

Mindfulness 
Worries about AI and the Environment 
Future of Apache NuttX and what's my role in it
Taking care of my family 
Will I inherit Alzheimer's?
Will I ever complete this article?
Why is USB UART broken?

AI Vs groundedness
Maintain sanity and health 

The flow? Coding for hours on mountain dew
Nope be mindful of the present, here and now 
Watch where you're running 
How you're running 
Don't get injured or overexert 
Refreshingly different from coding for hours and hours, high on stimulants

Paranoid about losing count 
Stop at 18
Mis count 
So much for mindfulness!

Express gratitude 
Glorious tan
Sweat moisturising skin

# What's Next

TODO

Putrajaya Miri
Return to NuttX?
Not sure
Still doing day to day operations
Checking the daily tests for avoata, starpro64, oz64
Might be the most that i can do for now 

Discover new places in neighbouring countries
50 k ultra 
Half marathon 

Still daily monitoring oz64, starpro64, avaota a1
