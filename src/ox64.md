# Ox64 BL808 RISC-V SBC

_What's this BL808?_ [(Datasheet)](https://github.com/bouffalolab/bl_docs/blob/main/BL808_DS/en/BL808_DS_1.2_en.pdf) [(Reference Manual)](https://github.com/bouffalolab/bl_docs/blob/main/BL808_RM/en/BL808_RM_en_1.3.pdf)

BL808 is a complex creature with 3 (Asymmetric) RISC-V Cores (linked via IPC)...

1.  D0 Core: [T-Head C906 64-bit RV64IMAFCV](https://www.t-head.cn/product/c906?lang=en) (480 MHz)

    (Multimedia Core with MIPI CSI / DSI, Neural Proc Unit)

    (Memory Mgmt Unit is Sv39, 128/256/512 TLB table entry. Same as Star64?)

1.  M0 Core: [T-Head E907 32-bit RV32IMAFCP](https://www.t-head.cn/product/e907?lang=en) (320 MHz)

    (Wireless + Peripherals Core with WiFi, BLE, BT, Zigbee, Audio)

1.  LP Core: [T-Head E902 32-bit RV32E[M]C](https://www.t-head.cn/product/e902?lang=en) (150 MHz)

    (Low Power Core)

[Pine64 Ox64](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Ox64) is the dev board for BL808C.

(BL808C supports MIPI CSI Cameras but not MIPI DSI Displays. Maybe someday we'll see BL808D for MIPI DSI Displays)

_Is Ox64 BL808 an SBC? Or an MCU Board?_

Technically Ox64 BL808 boots 64-bit RISC-V Linux (via MicroSD), so it feels like an SBC...

- ["Booting Linux on the Pine64 Ox64 SBC"](https://adventurist.me/posts/00317)

- [OpenBouffalo Wiki](https://openbouffalo.org/index.php/Main_Page)

- [Linux Image + OpenSBI + U-Boot Bootloader for BL808](https://github.com/openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo)

  [(Newer version?)](https://github.com/bouffalolab/buildroot_bouffalo)

  [(OpenSBI is the BIOS for RISC-V SBCs)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/sbi)

- USB-C Port for Camera Module (Dual-Lane MIPI CSI)

  (USB-C is not for Flashing!)

- USB 2.0 support for USB OTG

  (On-The-Go = USB Host + USB Device)

But Ox64 BL808 also feels like an MCU Board...

- Form Factor is similar to MCU Board

- Limited Memory: 64 MB of RAM, [128 Megabits](https://pine64.com/product/128mb-ox64-sbc-available-on-december-2-2022/) (16 MB) of Flash Memory

- M0 Wireless Core is 32-bit RISC-V MCU

- UART Pins need a USB Serial Adapter for Flashing and Console I/O

- Powered by Micro USB Port

  (Micro USB is not for Flashing either!)

- Super Affordable: [$8 for a 64-bit RISC-V Board!](https://pine64.com/product/128mb-ox64-sbc-available-on-december-2-2022/)

_Ox64 BL808 sounds a little tiny for 64-bit Linux?_

Yeah 64-bit Linux runs with Limited RAM on the D0 Multimedia Core. But most Peripherals are hosted on the M0 Wireless Core: WiFi, BLE, BT, Zigbee, Audio, ...

So we flash M0 with a simple 32-bit RISC-V Firmware, to forward the Peripheral Interrupts from M0 to D0 Linux.

Here are the binaries loaded into D0 Multimedia Core and M0 Wireless Core, from [buildroot_bouffalo](https://github.com/openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo)...

* __d0_lowload_bl808_d0.bin__: This is a very basic bootloader that loads opensbi, the kernel and dts files into ram

* __m0_lowload_bl808_m0.bin__: This firmware runs on M0 and forwards interupts to the D0 for several peripherals

* __bl808-firmware.bin__: An image containing OpenSBI, Uboot and uboot dtb files. 

* __sdcard-*.tar.xz__: A tarball containing the rootfs for the image to be flashed to the SD card

Perhaps Ox64 BL808 might run more efficiently with a tiny 64-bit RTOS.

_Why Apache NuttX RTOS?_

It might be interesting to run Apache NuttX RTOS on both the D0 Multimedia Core and the M0 Wireless Core. Then D0 and M0 can talk over OpenAMP (Asymmetric Multi-Processing).

Let's explore...

# Flashing UART vs Serial Console

![Flashing UART vs Serial Console](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/ox64-pinout.jpg)

_We need to handle TWO UART Ports on Ox64?_

Yeah don't confuse the 2 UART Ports on Ox64! Let's give the UART Ports distinctive names [(like Migi & Dali)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migi_%26_Dali)...

1.  __Ox64 Flashing UART__: Used for Flashing Ox64

    + Flashing UART TX is __GPIO 14__ (Physical Pin 1)
    + Flashing UART RX is __GPIO 15__ (Physical Pin 2)
    + Remember to connect GND
    + Baud Rate for Normal Mode: 2,000,000 (2 Mbps)
    + Baud Rate for Flashing Mode: 230,400 (230.4 kbps)
    + BL808 UART0 is controlled by the M0 Wireless Core (OpenBouffalo Firmware)

1.  __Ox64 Serial Console__: Used for Linux Serial Console (plus OpenSBI and U-Boot Bootloader)

    + Serial Console TX is __GPIO 16__ (Physical Pin 32)
    + Serial Console RX is __GPIO 17__ (Physical Pin 31)
    + Remember to connect GND
    + Baud Rate: 2,000,000 (2 Mbps)
    + BL808 UART3 is controlled by the D0 Multimedia Core (Linux + OpenSBI + U-Boot)
    + Output is totally blank if OpenBouffalo Firmware [wasn't flashed correctly](https://github.com/openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo/issues/60), or if OpenSBI / U-Boot / Linux couldn't boot

NEITHER UART Port is accessible over USB-C or Micro USB. So yeah it's totally counterintuitive.

(Maybe someone can create a Stackable HAT or Breadboard, that will expose the 2 UART Ports as USB Dongles? Or a UART Switcher?)

[(__For Pre-Production Ox64:__ Physical Pins are different, but GPIOs above are correct)](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/ox64-sd.jpg)

_Why 2 Baud Rates for Flashing UART?_

When we power up Ox64 in __Normal Mode__: (Boot Button NOT pressed)

- Flashing UART Port will show us the OpenBouffalo Firmware running on M0 Wireless Core

- This M0 Firmware will forward Peripheral Interrupts to D0 Multimedia Core

- M0 Firmware is hardcoded for 2 Mbps

- Not really fun to watch. But we use this for testing our 2 Mbps USB Serial Adapter.

When we power up Ox64 in __Flashing Mode__: (Boot Button pressed)

- Ox64 is ready for Firmware Flashing by the BL DevCube GUI Tool

- Firmware Flashing supports various Baud Rates: 230.4 kbps, 2 Mbps, ...

- But 2 Mbps will fail on macOS. That's why we Flash Firmware at 230.4 kbps.

  [(Same problem when flashing BL602)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/flash#flash-the-firmware)

_Serial Console is always 2 Mbps?_

Yeah 2 Mbps is hardcoded in Ox64 Linux. Switching to other Baud Rates will show garbled text.

Thus our USB Serial Adapter must connect reliably to Ox64 at 2 Mbps.

Now we flash Ox64 and boot Linux...

# Flash OpenSBI and U-Boot Bootloader to Ox64 BL808

Before booting Linux on Ox64, we flash OpenSBI + U-Boot Bootloader to D0 Multimedia Core, and the Peripheral Interrupt Firmware to M0 Wireless Core. From [buildroot_bouffalo](https://github.com/openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo):

* __d0_lowload_bl808_d0.bin__: This is a very basic bootloader that loads opensbi, the kernel and dts files into ram

* __m0_lowload_bl808_m0.bin__: This firmware runs on M0 and forwards interupts to the D0 for several peripherals

* __bl808-firmware.bin__: An image containing OpenSBI, Uboot and uboot dtb files. 

Here are the steps, based on the [Official Flashing Instructions](https://github.com/openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo#flashing-instructions)...

1.  We tested with [Pine64 Woodpecker CH340G USB Serial Adapter](https://pine64.com/product/serial-console-woodpecker-edition/) on macOS x64.

    Warning: Some USB Serial Adapters [WON'T WORK!](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Ox64#Compatible_UARTs_when_in_bootloader_mode)

    Probably because we are connecting at 2 Mbps, which might be too fast for some USB Serial Adapters.

    [(Like this CP2102, which shows garbled text at 2 Mbps)](https://www.lazada.sg/products/i2037772272-s11135131253.html)

    ![Flashing UART](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/ox64-pinout2.jpg)

1.  To Test our USB Serial Adapter: Connect the USB Serial Adapter to __Ox64 Flashing UART__ (pic above)...
    + Flashing UART TX is __GPIO 14__ (Physical Pin 1)
    + Flashing UART RX is __GPIO 15__ (Physical Pin 2)
    + Remember to connect GND
    + Baud 2,000,000 (2 Mbps)

    Start the USB Serial Terminal (Flashing UART).

    Power up Ox64 via the Micro USB Port. Ox64 Green LED should light up.

    This Clickety Micro USB Cable is very handy for rebooting Ox64...

    ![Clickety Micro USB Cable](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/ox64-usb.jpg)

1.  In the USB Serial Terminal (Flashing UART), we should see the Ox64 Factory Test Firmware...

    [(Source)](https://gist.github.com/lupyuen/43676407bbced733e65566879e18732b)

1.  Pre-Flash Check: Set BL808 board to programming mode
    + Remove the microSD Card
    + Press and Hold BOOT Button
    + Unplug and replug the Micro USB Port
    + Release BOOT button
    + Ox64 Green LED should turn on

    In the USB Serial Terminal (Flashing UART), we should see this...

    ```text
    .
    ```

    Yep Ox64 is ready for flashing!

1.  Now we prepare to flash:

    Disconnect the USB Serial Terminal (to release the Flashing UART)

    Set BL808 board to programming mode
    + Remove the microSD Card
    + Press and Hold BOOT Button
    + Unplug and replug the Micro USB Port
    + Release BOOT button
    + Ox64 Green LED should turn on

1.  We download the Ox64 Binaries...

    - [bl808-linux-pine64_ox64_full_defconfig.tar.gz](https://github.com/openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo/releases/download/v1.0.1/bl808-linux-pine64_ox64_full_defconfig.tar.gz) 

    From the latest Ox64 Linux Release...

    - [openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo (Release v1.0.1)](https://github.com/openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo/releases/tag/v1.0.1)

    Unzip the download and we should see this...

    ```bash
    → ls -l firmware
       7340032  bl808-firmware.bin
         31360  d0_lowload_bl808_d0.bin

      43859444  sdcard-pine64_ox64_full_defconfig.img.xz    
    ```

1.  We'll run Bouffalo Lab DevCube for Flashing BL808.

    Only Ubuntu x64, macOS and Windows are supported.

    TODO: How to flash BL808 on Arm64 SBCs and Pinebook Pro? Sigh. See [bflb-iot-tool / bflb-mcu-tool](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Ox64#Alternative:_Open-Source_Flashing)

1.  Download Bouffalo Lab DevCube 1.8.3 from...

    [(1.8.4 and later won't work)](https://github.com/openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo/issues/60)

    In BL Dev Cube, UART Rate (for MCU and IoT) should be 230400.

    Don't set to 2000000, it will fail on macOS!

    [(Same problem when flashing BL602)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/flash#flash-the-firmware)

Let's load Ox64 Linux into a microSD Card...

# Boot Linux on Ox64 BL808

![Ox64 Linux in a microSD Card](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/ox64-sd.jpg)

Now that D0 Multimedia Core is flashed with OpenSBI and U-Boot Bootloader, we're ready to boot Linux on microSD!

Based on the [Official Flashing Instructions](https://github.com/openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo#flashing-instructions)...

1.  Look for the microSD Image that we downloaded earlier...

    ```text

    Check that we are using [Bouffalo Lab DevCube 1.8.3](https://openbouffalo.org/static-assets/bldevcube/BouffaloLabDevCube-v1.8.3.zip)

    [(1.8.4 and later won't work)](https://github.com/openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo/issues/60)

    In BL Dev Cube, UART Rate (for MCU and IoT) should be 230400.

    Don't set to 2000000, it will fail on macOS!

    [(Same problem when flashing BL602)](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/flash#flash-the-firmware)

1.  If we see...

    ```text
    U-Boot 2023.04-rc2 (Mar 06 2023 - 11:48:40 +0000)
    Card did not respond to voltage select! : -110

# Inspect the Linux Image for Ox64 BL808

_Will Apache NuttX RTOS boot on Ox64 BL808?_

Let's examine the Linux Kernel Image for Ox64, and we replicate the same format for NuttX. (Which is how we ported NuttX to 64-bit RISC-V Star64 JH7110 SBC)

We download the Ox64 Binaries...

- [bl808-linux-pine64_ox64_full_defconfig.tar.gz](https://github.com/openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo/releases/download/v1.0.1/bl808-linux-pine64_ox64_full_defconfig.tar.gz) 

From the latest Ox64 Linux Release...

- [openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo (Release v1.0.1)](https://github.com/openbouffalo/buildroot_bouffalo/releases/tag/v1.0.1)

Unzip it and mount the SD Card Image...

```bash
→ ls -l sdcard-pine64_ox64_full_defconfig     
-  13,154,816  Image
-       4,012  bl808-pine64-ox64.dtb
-       4,106  bl808-sipeed-m1s.dtb
-         350  boot-m1s.scr
-         352  boot-pine64.scr
-         352  boot.scr
d          96  extlinux
```

Dump the `Image` as hex...

```bash
→ hexdump sdcard-pine64_ox64_full_defconfig/Image
0000000 4d 5a 6f 10 20 08 01 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 00 00
0000010 00 80 cd 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0000020 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0000030 52 49 53 43 56 00 00 00 52 53 43 05 40 00 00 00
```

The Linux Kernel Image begins with this __RISC-V Linux Image Header__...

-   [__"Boot Image Header in RISC-V Linux"__](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/riscv/boot-image-header.html)

Here are the decoded bytes...

1.  __code0__: Executable code

    (4 bytes, offset `0x00`)

    ```text
    4d 5a 6f 10 
    ```

1.  __code1__: Executable code 

    (4 bytes, offset `0x04`)

    ```text
    20 08 01 00 
    ```

1.  __text_offset__: Image load offset, little endian

    (8 bytes, offset `0x08`)

    ```text
    00 00 20 00 00 00 00 00
    ```

1.  __image_size__: Effective Image size, little endian 

    (8 bytes, offset `0x10`)

    ```text
    00 80 cd 00 00 00 00 00
    ```

1.  __flags__: Kernel flags, little endian 

    (8 bytes, offset `0x18`)

    ```text
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
    ```

1.  __version__: Version of this header (_MinL_ _MinM_ `.` _MajL_ _MajM_)

    (4 bytes, offset `0x20`)

    ```text
    02 00 00 00
    ```

1.  __res1__: Reserved

    (4 bytes, offset `0x24`)

    ```text
    00 00 00 00
    ```

1.  __res2__: Reserved

    (8 bytes, offset `0x28`)

    ```text
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
    ```

1.  __magic__: Magic number, little endian, "RISCV\x00\x00\x00" 
    
    (8 bytes, offset `0x30`)

    ```text
    52 49 53 43 56 00 00 00
    ```

1.  __magic2__: Magic number 2, little endian, "RSC\x05" 

    (4 bytes, offset `0x38`)

    ```text
    52 53 43 05
    ```

1.  __res3__: Reserved for PE COFF offset

    (4 bytes, offset `0x3C`)
    
    ```text
    40 00 00 00
    ```

Our NuttX Kernel shall __recreate this RISC-V Linux Image Header__. (Total `0x40` bytes)

(Or U-Boot Bootloader might refuse to boot NuttX)

Header Values are exactly the same as Star64. (Except the Image Size and Executable Code, since the Jump Address is different)

Thus we simply reuse the code from NuttX Star64!
