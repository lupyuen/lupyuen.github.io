# Build a LoRaWAN Network with RAKwireless WisGate Developer Gateway

📝 _3 May 2021_

While testing a new LoRaWAN gadget ([PineCone BL602](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/lora2)), I bought a LoRaWAN Gateway from RAKwireless: [__RAK7248 WisGate Developer D4H Gateway__](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisGate/RAK7248/Datasheet/).

Here's what I learnt about settting up a LoRaWAN Network with WisGate Developer D4H... And testing it with the RAKwireless WisBlock dev kit.

# WisGate D4H Hardware

WisGate D4H is essentially a Raspberry Pi 4 + LoRaWAN Concentrator in a sturdy IP30 box.

It exposes the same ports and connectors as a Raspberry Pi 4: Ethernet port, USB 2 and 3 ports, USB-C power, microSD Card.

But the HDMI and GPIO ports are no longer accessible. (We control the box over HTTP and SSH)

2 new connectors have been added...

1.  __LoRa Antenna__ (left)

1.  __GPS Antenna__ (right)

(The two connectors are slightly different, so we won't connect the wrong antenna)

The GPS Antenna will be used when we connect WisGate to The Things Network (the worldwide free-access LoRaWAN network).

WisGate D4H is shipped with the open-source ChirpStack LoRaWAN stack, preinstalled in the microSD card. 

(Yep please don't peel off the sticky tape and insert your own microSD card)

# ChirpStack LoRaWAN Stack

Connect the LoRa Antenna to GPS Antenna to WisGate before powering on. (To prevent damage to the RF modules)

Follow the instructions here to start the WisGate box and to connect to the preinstalled ChirpStack LoRaWAN stack...

(RAK7244C is quite similar to our RAK7248 gateway)
